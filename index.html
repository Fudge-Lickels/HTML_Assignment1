        <div>Quick introduction to myself.<br>
        My name is Hasinah Walljee. I'm an Aquarius born February 18th 2002 in South Africa.<br>
        I have been told that I'm a sensitive person however, <br>
        I tend to be emotionally insensitive to others.<br>
        I prefer to say what I think and mean, 
        a relatively blunt person that is often considered rude.<br>
        I graduated IIE Rosebank College with a Diploma in IT Software Development.<br>
        I have a younger sister who resides with my mother whilst I live with my grandmother<br>
